        <p>This app controls the Enchanted Rose prop via Bluetooth.</p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure batteries are fresh!</li>
            <li>Turn on Servo Switch, Accent Light Switch, and plug in Arduino. Then, launch the app.</li>
            <li>On your phone, double-check that Bluetooth is on</li>
            
            <li>The prop has three power sources: one for the Arduino board, one for the servo motors and one for the lights. Double-check that they are all connected.</li>
            <li>If the app background isn't in color, the app cannot reach the prop. Verify all three prop switches are flipped UP (on), then close this app and re-launch.</li>
