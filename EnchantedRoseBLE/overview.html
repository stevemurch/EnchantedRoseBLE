        <p>This app controls the Enchanted Rose prop via Bluetooth.</p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure batteries are fresh!</li>
            <li>On your phone, double-check that Bluetooth is on</li>
            <li>Reset the petals to their leftmost position and then check CAREFULLY under the prop to ensure the wires are all connected and go through the stem up to the flower.</li>
            <li>The petals should just have enough of a grip on the wires to hang on. The wires only move about a half inch at most when the petals are dropped.</li>
            <li>The prop has three power sources: one for the Arduino board, one for the servo motors and one for the lights. Double-check that they are all connected.</li>
            <li>If app doesn't show "Ready", verify prop is all turned on, then close this app and re-launch.</li>
            <li>Slide the slider controls to drop the petals.</li>
            </ol>
